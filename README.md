# automating_the_internet

The goal is to fully write automated test cases for the following website https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/.

This website has almost 44 subpages with almost all of the functionalities found on a modern website.

The technology stack used for this project is the following:

- **Python 3.9** or **Python 3.10** as the programming language
- **unittest** as the testing framework
- **Selenium WebDriver** as the automation framework
- **chromedriver** as the main remote control interface
- **geckodriver** as the secondary remote control interface
- **Visual Studio Code** as the main integrated development environment
- **PyCharm** as the secondary integrated development environment
- **GitHub** as the version control system
- more than 5 years of experience as a Senior Software Tester

By completing this project, I hope to understand the basics of **Automation Testing**.
